<p>In the limited compass of this small volume, the compiler has
endeavored to employ only such material as is likely to prove of
service to the largest circle of readers. Nearly four hundred subjects
have received consideration at his hands, and the quotations given are
from standard authors of recognized ability. Upwards of twenty-five
hundred extracts from the choicest literature of all ages and tongues,
topically arranged, and in scope so wide as to touch on nearly every
subject that engages the human mind, constitute a treasury of thought
which, it is hoped, will be acceptable and helpful to all into whose
hands this volume may chance to fall.</p>

<p class="sec"><b><big><a name="Ability" id="Ability"></a>Ability.</big></b>&mdash;No man is without some quality, by the due application of
which he might deserve well of the world; and whoever he be that has
but little in his power should be in haste to do that little, lest he
be confounded with him that can do nothing.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson</span>.</p>

<p>We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others
judge us by what we have already done.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow</span>.</p>

<p>Every person is responsible for all the good within the scope of his
abilities, and for no more.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gail Hamilton</span>.</p>

<p>The possession of great powers no doubt carries with it a contempt for
mere external show.&mdash;<span class="smcap">James A. Garfield</span>.</p>

<p>The art of using moderate abilities to advantage wins praise, and
often acquires more reputation than actual brilliancy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">La
Rochefoucauld</span>.</p>

<p>Ability is a poor man's wealth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew Wren</span>.</p>

<p>The measure of capacity is the measure of sphere to either man or
woman.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Oakes Smith</span>.</p>

<p>Natural ability can almost compensate for the want of every kind of
cultivation; but no cultivation of the mind can make up for the want
of natural ability.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Schopenhauer</span>.</p>

<p>An able man shows his spirit by gentle words and resolute
actions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chesterfield</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>


<p class="sec"><b><big>Absolution.</big></b>&mdash;No man taketh away sins (which the law, though holy,
just and good, could not take away), but He in whom there is no
sin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bede</span>.</p>

<p>He alone can remit sins who is appointed our Master by the Father of
all; He only is able to discern obedience from disobedience.&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
Clement of Alexandria</span>.</p>

<p>It is not the ambassador, it is not the messenger, but the Lord
Himself that saveth His people. The Lord remaineth alone, for no man
can be partner with God in forgiving sins; this office belongs solely
to Christ, who taketh away the sins of the world.&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
Ambrose</span>.</p>

<p>It appertaineth to the true God alone to be able to loose men from
their sins.&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Cyril</span>.</p>

<p>Neither angel, nor archangel, nor yet even the Lord Himself (who alone
can say "I am with you"), can, when we have sinned, release us, unless
we bring repentance with us.&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Ambrose</span>.</p>


<p class="sec"><b><big>Action.</big></b>&mdash;The thing done avails, and not what is said about
it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Emerson</span>.</p>

<p>Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness
without action.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Beaconsfield</span>.</p>

<p>There are three sorts of actions: those that are good, those that are
bad, and those that are doubtful; and we ought to be most cautious of
those that are doubtful; for we are in most danger of these doubtful
actions, because they do not alarm us; and yet they insensibly lead to
greater transgressions, just as the shades of twilight gradually
reconcile us to darkness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. Reed</span>.</p>

<p>To the valiant actions speak alone.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smollett</span>.</p>

<p>It is well to think well: it is divine to act well.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace
Mann</span>.</p>

<p>Active natures are rarely melancholy. Activity and melancholy are
incompatible.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bovee</span>.</p>

<span class="i1">Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is our destined end or way;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But to act, that each to-morrow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Finds us farther than to-day.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Act, act, in the living Present!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heart within, and God o'erhead!<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Longfellow.<br /></span>
</div></div>



<p>Every man feels instinctively that all the beautiful sentiments in the
world weigh less than a single lovely action.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lowell</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Prodigious actions may as well be done<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By weaver's issue, as by prince's son.<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Dryden.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not to taste sweet things, but to do noble and true things, and
vindicate himself under God's heaven as a God-made man, that the
poorest son of Adam dimly longs. Show him the way of doing that, the
dullest day-drudge kindles into a hero.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>.</p>

<p>Deliberate with caution, but act with decision; and yield with
graciousness, or oppose with firmness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colton</span>.</p>

<p>When our souls shall leave this dwelling, the glory of one fair and
virtuous action is above all the scutcheons on our tomb, or silken
banners over us.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. Shirley</span>.</p>

<p>Our acts make or mar us,&mdash;we are the children of our own
deeds.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Victor Hugo</span>.</p>

<p>Man, being essentially active, must find in activity his joy, as well
as his beauty and glory; and labor, like everything else that is good,
is its own reward.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whipple</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>


<p class="sec"><b><big>Adversity.</big></b>&mdash;Times of great calamity and confusion have ever been
productive of the greatest minds. The purest ore is produced from the
hottest furnace, and the brightest thunderbolt is elicited from the
darkest storm.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colton</span>.</p>

<p>In the day of prosperity we have many refuges to resort to; in the day
of adversity only one.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horatius Bonar</span>.</p>

<p>Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortunes; but great minds
rise above them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Washington Irving</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But were we burden'd with like weight of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Heaven is not always angry when he strikes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But most chastises those whom most he likes.<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Pomfret.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fire of my adversity has purged the mass of my
acquaintance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bolingbroke</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">On every thorn delightful wisdom grows;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In every rill a sweet instruction flows.<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Dr. Young.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">When Providence, for secret ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Corroding cares, or sharp affliction, sends;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We must conclude it best it should be so,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And not desponding or impatient grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Pomfret.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is
small.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs 24:10</span>.</p>

<p>Adversity has the effect of eliciting talents, which, in prosperous
circumstances, would have lain dormant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">In this wild world the fondest and the best<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are the most tried, most troubled and distress'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Crabbe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>The lessons of adversity are often the most benignant when they seem
the most severe. The depression of vanity sometimes ennobles the
feeling. The mind which does not wholly sink under misfortune rises
above it more lofty than before, and is strengthened by
affliction.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chenevix</span>.</p>

<p>There is healing in the bitter cup.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Southey</span>.</p>

<p>Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament, adversity is the
blessing of the New, which carrieth the greater benediction, and the
clearer revelation of God's favor.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bacon</span>.</p>

<p>In all cases of heart-ache, the application of another man's
disappointment draws out the pain and allays the
irritation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lytton</span>.</p>

<p>Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hebrews 12:6</span>.</p>

<p>The brightest crowns that are worn in heaven have been tried and
smelted and polished and glorified through the furnace of
tribulation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chapin</span>.</p>

<p>Genuine morality is preserved only in the school of adversity, and a
state of continuous prosperity may easily prove a quicksand to
virtue.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Schiller</span>.</p>


<p class="sec"><b><big>Affectation.</big></b>&mdash;Affectation is the wisdom of fools, and the folly of
many a comparatively wise man.</p>

<p>We are never rendered so ridiculous by qualities which we possess, as
by those which we aim at, or affect to have.&mdash;<span class="smcap">From the
French</span>.</p>

<p>Affectation is a greater enemy to the face than the
small-pox.&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Evremond</span>.</p>

<p>All affectation is the vain and ridiculous attempt of poverty to
appear rich.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lavater</span>.</p>

<p>Affectation hides three times as many virtues as charity does
sins.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace Mann</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>


<p class="sec"><b><big>Affection.</big></b>&mdash;A loving heart is the truest wisdom.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dickens</span>.</p>

<p>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
earth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colossians 3:2</span>.</p>

<p>Caresses, expressions of one sort or another, are necessary to the
life of the affections as leaves are to the life of a tree. If they
are wholly restrained love will die at the roots.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hawthorne</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">A solitary blessing few can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our joys with those we love are intertwined,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he whose wakeful tenderness removes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The obstructing thorn that wounds the breast he loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Smooths not another's rugged path alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But scatters roses to adorn his own.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Affection is a garden, and without it there would not be a verdant
spot on the surface of the globe.</p>

<p>Of all earthly music, that which reaches the farthest into heaven is
the beating of a loving heart.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Beecher</span>.</p>

<p>If there is anything that keeps the mind open to angel visits, and
repels the ministry of ill, it is human love.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Willis</span>.</p>


<p class="sec"><b><big>Affliction.</big></b>&mdash;God sometimes washes the eyes of his children with
tears in order that they may read aright His providence and His
commandments.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T.L. Cuyler</span>.</p>

<p>The truest help we can render an afflicted man is not to take his
burden from him, but to call out his best energy, that he may be able
to bear the burden.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Phillips Brooks</span>.</p>

<p>Every man deems that he has precisely the trials and temptations which
are the hardest of all for him to bear; but they are so, because they
are the very ones he needs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richter</span>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Affliction is but the shadow of God's wing.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George
Macdonald</span>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Aromatic plants bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No spicy fragrance where they grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But crushed and trodden to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Diffuse their balmy sweets around.<br /></span>
<span class="i11 smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Affliction appears to be the guide to reflection; the teacher of
humility; the parent of repentance; the nurse of faith; the
strengthener of patience, and the promoter of charity.</p>

<p>Extraordinary afflictions are not always the punishment of
extraordinary sins, but sometimes the trial of extraordinary
graces.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew Henry</span>.</p>

<p>If you would not have affliction visit you twice, listen at once to
what it teaches.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Burgh</span>.</p>

<p>Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Job 5:7</span>.</p>

<span class="i1">Affliction is the wholesome soul of virtue;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where patience, honor, sweet humanity,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>With the wind of tribulation God separates in the floor of the soul,
the chaff from the corn.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Molinos</span>.</p>

<p>No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:
nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hebrews
12:11</span>.</p>


<p class="sec"><b><big>Age.</big></b>&mdash;No wise man ever wished to be younger.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swift</span>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>I venerate old age; and I love not the man who can look without
emotion upon the sunset of life, when the dusk of evening begins to
gather over the watery eye, and the shadows of twilight grow broader

him of his error. Expecting him on a visit, he placed a handsome
celestial globe in a part of the room where it could not escape the
notice of his friend, who, on observing it, inquired whence it came,
and who was the maker.</p>

<p>"It was not made by any person," said the astronomer.</p>

<p>"That is impossible," replied the sceptic; "you surely jest."</p>

<p>Kircher then took occasion to reason with his friend upon his own
atheistical principles, explaining to him that he had adopted this
plan with a design to show him the fallacy of his scepticism.</p>

<p>"You will not," said he, "admit that this small body originated in
mere chance, and yet you contend that those heavenly bodies, to which
it bears only a faint and diminutive resemblance, came into existence
without author or design."</p>

<p>Never lose a chance of saying a kind word. As Collingwood never saw a

about doing good.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nevins</span>.</p>

<p>Benevolence is not in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth. It
is a business with men as they are, and with human life as drawn by
the rough hand of experience. It is a duty which you must perform at
the call of principle; though there be no voice of eloquence to give
splendor to your exertions, and no music of poetry to lead your
willing footsteps through the bowers of enchantment. It is not the
impulse of high and ecstatic emotion. It is an exertion of principle.
You must go to the poor man's cottage, though no verdure flourish
around it, and no rivulet be nigh to delight you by the gentleness of
its murmurs. If you look for the romantic simplicity of fiction you
will be disappointed; but it is your duty to persevere, in spite of
every discouragement. Benevolence is not merely a feeling but a
principle; not a dream of rapture for the fancy to indulge in, but a
business for the hand to execute.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chalmers</span>.</p>

<p>Beneficence is a duty. He who frequently practices it, and sees his
benevolent intentions realized, at length comes really to love him to
whom he has done good. When, therefore, it is said, "Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself," it is not meant, thou shalt love him first
and do him good in consequence of that love, but, thou shalt do good
to thy neighbor; and this thy beneficence will engender in thee that
love to mankind which is the fulness and consummation of the
inclination to do good.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kant</span>.</p>

it "is kind," and so it is courtesy; it "vaunteth not itself," and so
it is modesty; it "is not puffed up," and so it is humility; it "is
not easily provoked," and so it is lenity; it "thinketh no evil," and
so it is simplicity; it "rejoiceth in the truth," and so it is verity;
it "beareth all things," and so it is fortitude; it "believeth all

of evidencing his repentance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Archbishop Secker</span>.</p>

<p>I have learned from Jesus Christ himself what charity is, and how we
ought to practise it; for He says, "By this shall all men know that ye

reason, the life of the heart, and the strength of the

<p>Since its introduction, human nature has made great progress, and
society experienced great changes; and in this advanced condition of
the world, Christianity, instead of losing its application and
importance, is found to be more and more congenial and adapted to
man's nature and wants. Men have outgrown the other institutions of
that period when Christianity appeared, its philosophy, its modes of
warfare, its policy, its public and private economy; but Christianity
has never shrunk as intellect has opened, but has always kept in
advance of men's faculties, and unfolded nobler views in proportion as
they have ascended. The highest powers and affections which our nature
has developed, find more than adequate objects in this religion.
Christianity is indeed peculiarly fitted to the more improved stages

<p>There is not a vice which more effectually contracts and deadens the
feelings, which more completely makes a man's affections centre in
himself, and excludes all others from partaking in them, than the
desire of accumulating possessions. When the desire has once gotten
hold on the heart, it shuts out all other considerations, but such as
may promote its views. In its zeal for the attainment of its end, it
is not delicate in the choice of means. As it closes the heart, so
also it clouds the understanding. It cannot discern between right and
wrong; it takes evil for good, and good for evil; it calls darkness
light, and light darkness. Beware, then, of the beginning of
covetousness, for you know not where it will end.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bishop

<p>A light wife doth make a heavy husband.</p>

<p>The following "marriage" maxims are worthy of more than a hasty
reading. Husbands should not pass them by, for they are designed for
wives; and wives should not despise them, for they are addressed to
husbands:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The very nearest approach to domestic happiness on earth is in the
cultivation on both sides of absolute unselfishness.</p>

<p>2. Never both be angry at once.</p>

<p>3. Never talk at one another, either alone or in company.</p>

<p>4. Never speak loud to one another unless the house is on fire.</p>

<p>5. Let each one strive to yield oftenest to the wishes of the other.</p>

<p>6. Let self-denial be the daily aim and practice of each.</p>

<p>7. Never find fault unless it is perfectly certain that a fault has
been committed, and always speak lovingly.</p>

<p>8. Never taunt with a past mistake.</p>

<p>9. Neglect the whole world besides rather than one another.</p>

<p>10. Never allow a request to be repeated.</p>

<p>11. Never make a remark at the expense of each other,&mdash;it is a
meanness.</p>

<p>12. Never part for a day without loving words to think of during
absence.</p>

<p>13. Never meet without a loving welcome.</p>

<p>14. Never let the sun go down upon any anger or grievance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>15. Never let any fault you have committed go by until you have
frankly confessed it and asked forgiveness.</p>

<p>16. Never forget the happy hours of early love.</p>

<p>17. Never sigh over what might have been, but make the best of what
is.</p>

<p>18. Never forget that marriage is ordained of God, and that His
blessing alone can make it what it should ever be.</p>

<p>19. Never be contented till you know you are both walking in the
narrow way.</p>

<p>20. Never let your hopes stop short of the eternal home.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cottager
and Artisan</span>.</p>

<p>The good wife is none of our dainty dames, who love to appear in a
variety of suits every day new; as if a good gown, like a stratagem in
war, were to be used but once. But our good wife sets up a sail

<p>Jars concealed are half reconciled; 'tis a double task, to stop the
breach at home and men's mouths abroad. To this end, a good husband
never publicly reproves his wife. An open reproof puts her to do
penance before all that are present; after which, many study rather
revenge than reformation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fuller</span>.</p>

<p>Every effort is made in forming matrimonial alliances to reconcile
matters relating to fortune, but very little is paid to the
congeniality of dispositions, or to the accordance of
hearts.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Massillon</span>.</p>

<p>A good wife is heaven's last best gift to man; his angel and minister
of graces innumerable; his gem of many virtues; his casket of jewels;
her voice his sweet music; her smiles his brightest day; her kiss the
guardian of his innocence; her arms the pale of his safety, the balm
of his health, the balsam of his life; her industry, his surest
wealth; her economy, his safest steward; her lips, his faithful

mere trifling at the moment, but have in after life discovered how

martyrdom; Patience produces unity in the church, loyalty in the
State, harmony in families and societies; she comforts the poor and
moderates the rich; she makes us humble in prosperity, cheerful in
adversity, unmoved by calumny and reproach; she teaches us to forgive
those who have injured us, and to be the first in asking forgiveness
of those whom we have injured; she delights the faithful, and invites

<p>Mr. Johnson had never, by his own account, been a close student, and
used to advise young people never to be without a book in their
pocket, to be read at bye-times, when they had nothing else to do. "It

<p>Let our reason, and not our senses, be the rule of our conduct; for
reason will teach us to think wisely, to speak prudently, and to
behave worthily.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Confucius</span>.</p>

<p>Though reason is not to be relied upon as universally sufficient to
direct us what to do, yet it is generally to be relied upon and obeyed
where it tells us what we are not to do.&mdash;<span class="smcap">South</span>.</p>

<p>He that will not reason is a bigot, he that cannot reason is a fool,
and he that dares not reason is a slave.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir W. Drummond</span>.</p>

<p>Wise men are instructed by reason; men of less understanding, by

<p>When a man has not a good reason for doing a thing, he has one good
reason for letting it alone.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>.</p>

<p>One can never repeat too often, that reason, as it exists in man, is
only our intellectual eye, and that, like the eye, to see, it needs
light,&mdash;to see clearly and far, it needs the light of Heaven.</p>

<p>The language of reason, unaccompanied by kindness, will often fail of
making an impression; it has no effect on the understanding, because
it touches not the heart. The language of kindness, unassociated with
reason, will frequently be unable to persuade; because, though it may
gain upon the affections, it wants that which is necessary to convince
the judgment. But let reason and kindness be united in a discourse,
and seldom will even pride or prejudice find it easy to
resist.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gisborne</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>The pulpit and the press have many commonplaces denouncing the thirst

<p>Wealth is not acquired, as many persons suppose, by fortunate
speculations and splendid enterprises, but by the daily practice of
industry, frugality, and economy. He who relies upon these means will
rarely be found destitute, and he who relies upon any other will
generally become bankrupt.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wayland</span>.</p>

<p>The way to wealth is as plain as the road to market. It depends
chiefly on two words,&mdash;industry and frugality.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Franklin</span>.</p>

<p>Wealth brings noble opportunities, and competence is a proper object
of pursuit; but wealth, and even competence, may be bought at too high
a price. Wealth itself has no moral attribute. It is not money, but
the love of money, which is the root of all evil. It is the relation
between wealth and the mind and the character of its possessor which
is the essential thing.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hillard</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us not envy some men their accumulated riches; their burden would

<p>In work consists the true pride of life; grounded in active

ornament, and he always consults his dignity by doing
it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>.</p>

<p>Work, according to my feeling, is as much of a necessity to man as
eating and sleeping. Even those who do nothing which to a sensible man
can be called work, still imagine that they are doing something. The
world possesses not a man who is an idler in his own
eyes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wilhelm von Humboldt</span>.</p>

<p>It is not work that kills men; it is worry. Work is healthy; you could
hardly put more upon a man than he can bear. Worry is rust upon the

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
